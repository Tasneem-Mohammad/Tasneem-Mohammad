# 👋 Hey there, I'm Tasneem!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate **Computer Science student** who's currently on a journey to **relearn web development from the ground up**. After taking a break, I'm back with a fresh mindset and a drive to build beautiful, responsive, and interactive websites using:

- 🧱 **HTML** – for structure  
- 🎨 **CSS** – for styling  
- ⚙️ **JavaScript** – for interactivity  

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

I'm focusing on the **frontend basics**, working on small projects that help me:
- Rebuild my understanding of core concepts
- Practice clean and readable code
- Gain confidence in developing UI components and features

## 🚀 Goals

- Strengthen my foundation in web development
- Learn modern tools and frameworks (eventually!)
- Share my learning journey and progress through GitHub

## 💬 Let's Connect

I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, or just a friendly chat about tech and learning!

Thanks for stopping by 🙌
